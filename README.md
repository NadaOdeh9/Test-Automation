# Test-Automation

Overview

This project is a test automation framework that automates the testing of a web application, an Android mobile app, and an API. It uses Java and several automation tools like Selenium, Cucumber, Appium, and REST Assured to cover different types of testing.

Whatâ€™s Included UI Tests (Web):

Automates test scenarios on the website https://www.saucedemo.com/ using Selenium and Cucumber. Supports Chrome and Firefox browsers. Uses a configuration file to control the browser and URL. Tests can run in parallel for faster execution. Follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. Automates a data-driven test that runs with multiple sets of data. Mobile Tests (Android):

Automates login scenarios (positive and negative) for the provided Android app. Uses Appium to interact with the mobile application. API Tests:

Automates basic API requests like GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE using REST Assured. Covers standard CRUD operations. Prerequisites Before running the tests, make sure you have the following installed:

Java (JDK 8+) Maven ChromeDriver (for Chrome) and GeckoDriver (for Firefox) Appium and Android Studio (for mobile testing) Git Tools and Technologies Java: Programming language used for writing the tests. Selenium WebDriver: Browser automation tool. Cucumber: Used to write test cases in plain English (Gherkin language). Junit: Manages test execution. REST Assured: For API testing. Appium: For mobile app automation. Extent Reports: Generates detailed test execution reports.

How to Run the Tests

Running UI Tests (Web) Configure the Tests:
Open the config.properties file and set the following values: browser=chrome (or firefox) url=https://www.saucedemo.com/ 2. Run the Tests. 3. View the Report: After the tests complete, a report is generated in the target/reports directory.

Running Mobile Tests (Android) Setup: Make sure Appium is installed and Android Studio is configured. Connect your Android device or start an emulator.

Test Scenarios

UI Test Scenarios

Invalid Login: Attempts to log in with incorrect credentials and verifies that the correct error message is displayed. Valid Login and Purchase:

Logs in with valid credentials.

Adds the two most expensive products to the cart.

Proceeds to checkout and verifies the total amount before taxes.

Completes the order and checks for a successful completion message.

Mobile Test Scenarios: Login Scenarios: Automates both positive and negative login scenarios in the Android app, verifying successful logins and handling invalid credentials.

API Test Scenarios: CRUD Operations: Automates basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using REST Assured.

Reports and Logging Test Reports: After running the tests, detailed reports are generated using Extent Reports. You can find them in the target/reports directory.
